## Overview

The **Netflix Data Files** repository provides a structured approach to understanding Netflix's vast content library. The dataset contains key metadata for each title, such as:

- Show ID
- Type (Movie/Series)
- Title
- Director
- Cast
- Country
- Date Added
- Release Year
- Rating
- Duration
- Description
- Type

Using Python, the data is processed and analyzed to uncover patterns, trends, and insights. Additionally, machine learning algorithms are used to generate personalized recommendations and analytics.

## Features

1. **Data Exploration and Visualization**
   - Analysis of content types, genres, and release patterns.
   - Visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

2. **Machine Learning for Recommendations**
   - Personalized title recommendations based on user preferences.

3. **Comprehensive Dataset**
   - Includes a well-structured CSV file containing Netflix titles and metadata.

4. **Interactive Jupyter Notebooks**
   - All code and results are presented in an easy-to-follow Jupyter Notebook.

## Technologies Used

  - **Python**
  - **Pandas**
  - **NumPy**
  - **Matplotlib**
  - **Seaborn**
  - **Scikit-learn**

- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **CSV Data Files**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix-data-files.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd netflix-data-files
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

6. Open the provided notebook file and start exploring the analysis.

## Usage

1. Open the `netflix_analysis.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Explore various analytics visualizations.
   - Generate personalized recommendations.
3. View results and insights directly within the notebook.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following key columns:

- **show_id**: Unique identifier for each title.
- **type**: Indicates if the content is a "Movie" or "TV Show".
- **title**: The title of the show or movie.
- **director**: Director(s) of the content.
- **cast**: Main cast members.
- **country**: Country of origin.
- **date_added**: When the content was added to Netflix.
- **release_year**: Year the content was released.
- **rating**: Content rating (e.g., PG, R).
- **duration**: Length of the movie or show (seasons).
- **description**: Short description of the content.

## Recommendations

The project includes a recommendation system that suggests Netflix titles based on user preferences and viewing history. Recommendations are generated using collaborative filtering and similarity-based techniques.
